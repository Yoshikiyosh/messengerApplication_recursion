Client-Server Information Exchange Application
This project is a simple application for exchanging information between a client and a server using Python socket communication and the faker package.

Overview of the Task
Client: Receives input from the user and sends it to the server.
Server: Receives messages from the client, generates appropriate responses, and sends them back to the client.
Creating the Client
The client waits for input from the user and sends it to the server.

Creating the Server
The server receives messages from the client, generates appropriate responses based on the received messages, and sends them back to the client.

Using the faker Package
The server utilizes the faker package to generate fake random strings or messages. This is useful when there are no actual responses or for testing purposes.
